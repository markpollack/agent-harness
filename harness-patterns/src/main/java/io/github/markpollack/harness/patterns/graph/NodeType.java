/**
 * Declares whether a {@link GraphNode} is deterministic or agent-driven.
 * <p>
 * This is the key distinction in the Blueprint Engine (Pattern 5):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #DETERMINISTIC} — pure computation; no LLM, no tokens, predictable cost,
 *       guaranteed termination. Suitable for: API calls, file I/O, data transformation,
 *       compilation, test runners, metrics collection.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #AGENT} — LLM-driven; consumes tokens, variable cost, may loop internally
 *       with tool calls. Suitable for: code analysis, implementation, evaluation,
 *       summarization, planning.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This declaration enables:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Per-node cost tracking (deterministic nodes always have zero token cost)</li>
 *   <li>Differentiated timeout policies (agent nodes need longer timeouts)</li>
 *   <li>Blueprint visualization (deterministic = rectangle, agent = rounded rectangle)</li>
 *   <li>Cost estimation before execution (sum agent node costs × expected token rates)</li>
 * </ul>
